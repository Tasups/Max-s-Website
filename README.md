Hi there! Welcome to AWS Cloud9!

To get started, create some files, play with the terminal,

Happy coding!

Current Notes:

06/12/23
Currently having issues with the mobile nav button due to the html, body, and header__main showing itself to be 900px when the view size is actually much smaller, about 300px. 
I've tried tweaking them but to no avail. Maybe shelf this until I get more information or requests to change it, seeing as this is a free website and I did it gratis.
